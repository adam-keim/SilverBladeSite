          <h4>Story Line</h4>
          <p> JAKOBS Ladder is a game set in a post-apocolyptic setting. The game is fun and easy to play. The game is a team first person sword fighting game with bows and crossbows. There is a level set up every kill gets you xp and gold in a game. Every time you level up you get more weapons to choose in a game.

        <div class="span6">
          <h4>5 Towers 8 Mini Towers Kingdom conques</h4>
          <p>There will be a large map with 5 zones the 4 nation's base and the middle tower. There will be 4 teams of about 8(min)-64( max) players on each team there will be need a program to even the teams. Each team will get 1 normal size tower and 2 mini sized towers To get gold and wood you either need to start mines and lumberjacks and upgrade them to get more amount of  gold or wood every 4 minutes. Each team can only have 3 mines and 3 lumberjacks. There will be wall protecting the main towers. The goal is to take control of all the main towers. But even if you take over the main tower of a nation, the nation is still in the game because of the min towers. A nation is kick if they lose all mini towers and towers. To take control of a tower you need to take down the gate or wall, then go to the king's court, and last of all you need to take down their flag, beware that there might be npc guards. May the best nation win.</p>

          <h4>Free For All</h4>
          <p>Free for all is just what it sounds like, arena where every man is for them self. There will be on tower in the middle and on the top there is area call the free zone. When any body enters the free zone you are not able to fight or kill for a full 2 mins. Once your time is up you will be warp to the lower levels of the tower. The free zone is the area where you may buy special weapons like the call of the pack, the bow sword and many more items that you may not have. The free zone also contains a spell shop that contains healing spells and warp spells and many ,more but each at a heavy price of gold. To earn god you must find treasure box s that drops every 10 minutes at a different area each time. The other way is to kill people, once you kill them they will drop 1\8 of their gold and you will gain the 1\8 of their gold. If the play that was killed has less than 10 gold they will not lose gold but the killer will gain 15 gold.</p>

          <h4>Kill Confirm</h4>
          <p>Kill confirm is like free for all but you must collect their crosses that each play drops when killed.There will be on tower in the middle and on the top there is area call the free zone. When any body enters the free zone you are not able to fight or kill for a full 2 mins. Once your time is up you will be warp to the lower levels of the tower.
